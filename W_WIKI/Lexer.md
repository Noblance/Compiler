A Lexer is a program or a process, that splits the code into little pieces, so called "tokens".

This little tokens have a type (like: return, semicolun, plus,...) and a value.

In a simple way to say, we devide our code to little "words".

For this you will need:

-) Class for Token (Type, value)
-) Method for Tokenizing (returns a List of Tokens)
-) A Enum for the Types of Tokens (e.g. Plus, Minus, Simocolon, Return)


BTW. A Token is not a character by it self, but rather a signal word in the code.
