Hello guys!
In this project I want to TRY to write a self-hosted compiler.
I am a very unexperienced student, so you know I don't know the deep, deep progress in the background.

I will use C# for my bootstrap compiler, this is the compiler, where you initially make your first lexer (analysing tokens) and your parser. I am using C# because I learned it at school and for me it is very easy
to just use that what i can.

What I know, the round about structure of creating a self-hosted compiler is:
 -) Lexer and Parser in the Bootstrap compiler to write the compiler in your own language
 -) Self-Hosted Compiler

I hope you have fun on this journey and let's begin.
