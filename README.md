Hello guys!
In this project I want to TRY to write a self-hosted compiler.
I am a very unexperienced student, so you know I don't know the deep, deep progress in the background.

I will use C# for my bootstrap compiler, this is the compiler, where you initially make your first lexer (analysing tokens) and your parser. I am using C# because I learned it at school and for me it is very easy
to just use that what i can.

What I know, the round about structure of creating a self-hosted compiler is:
 -) Lexer and Parser in the Bootstrap compiler to write the compiler in your own language
 -) Self-Hosted Compiler

I hope you have fun on this journey and let's begin.

And I am excusing straight upt for my bad english.

I am following or use the steps from https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj/blob/master/00_Introduction/Readme.md and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcSijrRsrY0&list=PLUDlas_Zy_qC7c5tCgTMYq2idyyT241qs


Generally we use a compiler to make more readable code to assembly code and then assemble this code and link some libraries in order to get an executable.

BTW we are gonna programm a C or C# like compiler, because most of the people would understand it better
